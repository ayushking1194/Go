Steps to Run a Simple Go Program in VS Code on macOS
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Open Terminal and check Go installation:
   $ go version

2. Open VS Code and create a new folder for your project:
   Example: hello-go

3. Open that folder in VS Code:
   File > Open Folder > Select your folder

4. Create a new file named main.go with the following content:

   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
   }

5. Open Terminal inside VS Code:
   - Shortcut: Ctrl + ` (backtick) or View > Terminal

6. Initialize the Go module (only once per project):
   $ go mod init hello-go

7. Run the Go program:
   $ go run main.go

Optional:
- To compile and run:
   $ go build main.go
   $ ./main

Note:
- If VS Code asks to install Go tools (gopls, gofmt, etc.), click "Install All".
- You can also use the "Code Runner" extension to run the code with a right-click > Run Code.
